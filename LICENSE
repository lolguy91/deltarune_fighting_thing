**Preamble**

The "I Don't Even Know What I'm Doing" License (IDK License) is a document of unparalleled confusion and whimsicality. This license governs the use, copying, distribution, and modification of the software project (hereinafter referred to as "the Chaos") created by lolguy91 (hereinafter referred to as "the Chaos Creator"). The IDK License is designed to promote a state of perpetual bewilderment and good-natured chaos.
